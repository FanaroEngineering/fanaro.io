      <h1>Scripted Classes vs Private Lessons</h1>

      <blockquote>
        A complete and thorough discussion on this topic likely demands and
        deserves a book, or many books, but I hope I'll be able to convey some
        insights throughout this article.

      <p>
        Scripted classes and group classes are definitely not the same, but I'll
        use them interchangeably from now on. That's mostly because private
        lessons, in contrast, when done well, are not scripted, and obviously
        not in group; and because typically group classes are scripted, for
        efficiency.
      </p>

      <p>
        The objections I lay below don't even come close to revealing anything
        like a solution, they are not a panacea. And they do not completely
        apply to many specific types of classes, e.g. team sports, medicine,
        forming psychologists, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are most of the main points I wish to discuss and address on this
        topic &mdash; the numbering below does not reflect any hierarchy of
        values, it's just for reference purposes &mdash;:

        My suggestion for reading the list below is to use a breadth-first
        approach: read the ordered items, then go ahead and read the subtopics

      <ol>
        <li>
          The current situation of the educational system is
          <em>understandable</em> but not <em>acceptable</em>.

          <ul>
            <li>
              It's 2021 and we are still stuck with the same educational system
              and logic from more than about 200 years ago. Everyone complains,
              everyone criticizes it, and we still can't seem to move on.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every ounce of effort spent trying to change the current system
              from within might backfire into preserving it. I'm not saying it
              will, but how many people have offered valuable changes to the
              current system only for it to still stay mostly the same after
              more than a hundred years?
            </li>
            <li>
              My suggestion is simple: lean more heavily on using technologies
              to help diminish the amount of repetitive teaching, while saving
              the teacher's time, which will be used in private lessons and
              invididual consulting.
            </li>
            <li>
              And no, I'm not advocating for the total extinction of group
              lecturing, I'm just arguing that it should be a much rarer
              occurrence than it is now, its benefits are diminishing everyday
              and the opportunity cost only grows, with new technologies.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The ability to record lectures diminishes the need for the repetitive
          task of lecturing, which frees up the teacher's time, leaving more
          time for private, targeted tutoring.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Up to maybe the 1950s, this was not possible, but we have come a
              long way now. The internet now grants us access to content from
              around the world, not only what can be shipped; and software gives
              us many more functionalities, like forums, commenting, interactive
              problem solving, live chatting with teachers, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Not to mention that, with recorded lectures and modern video
              players, the student is able to watch the content on his or her
              own pace, pausing whenever needed, and, more importantly,
              accelerating the video whenever possible, which is equivalent to
              living life faster basically.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Motivation has always been one of the major tasks of teaching.
          Mandatory lectures mask this, obfuscating the problem.

          <ul>
            <li>
              One of the major criticisms about leaning heavily on the recording
              lectures strategy is that the teacher now has to enforce students
              to watch lectures, because, if they don't, then she will (also)
              need to answer repetitive questions individually again and again.
              But allow me to reframe this objection: aren't students forced to
              watch lectures in the current system anyway? And isn't one of the
              most important aspects of teaching simply instilling motivation in
              students so they learn independently?
            </li>
            <li>
              Just like when discussing cryptocurrencies, every critique of new
              approaches seems to be, in reality, a critique of the shortcomings
              of the current system. The lack of motivation in current students
              isn't inherent to students, it's just a problem the current system
              fails to address. More passive, scripted lectures, and more
              mandatory subjects won't make the situation any better; in fact,
              anyone with the slightest of experience with the status quo will
              agree it will likely only make it worse
              <foot-note

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Scripted or group lectures do not offer almost any value when it comes
          social interactions. Most social interactions derived from them happen
          afterwards, which could also happen with recorded lectures anyway.

          <ul>
            <li>
              But what about the social aspect of being part of lectures? Well,
              that's as much bad logic as going to the cinemas for
              dating<foot-note
                text="If you want a slightly lengthier discussion on cinemas for
                dating, watch &lt;a href='https://youtu.be/T4TFRXUu3vg'&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;."
              ></foot-note
              >: you're not having almost any social interaction when all
              parties are individually focused. Most of the social aspect people
              remember coming from lectures actually come from
              <em>after</em> them. And that same conversation or interaction
              could happen if you had seen the lecture in video form,
              asynchronously. I do agree, though, that the social bond of live
              lectures &mdash; even when online actually &mdash; tends to be
              much stronger than other options, but I don't believe it justifies
              its existence as the default mode of learning, or outweighs its
              negatives.

          The best professionals almost all had crucial and great close
          instruction and coaching.

          <ul>
            <li>
              To me, that's a no-brainer when you analyze the best professionals
              in the market. Most of them have had great advisors or bosses in
              order to get to the top: master artisans don't learn everything
              from the ether, or books, or lectures. Even Mozart, likely the
              greatest musical genius, had the help of his father, one of the
              greatest violinist of his time<foot-note

            </li>
            <li>
              And coaching is much harder to do when all you can do is give
              generic instructions. A coach facilitates each student's or
              athlete's path by giving out personalized directions, after
              all<foot-note

        <li>
          No amount of lecturing will ever address all individual perspectives
          and perceptions of a subject.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Paraphrasing it, that means we cannot address all the possible
              interpretations students will get from having contact with a
              subject, which, then, requires either the teacher or the student
              to look for the blind spots and seek to fill in the lingering
              questions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trying to address all of the perspectives might also end up
              bloating the content into something overcomplicated or too long.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The current trend of teaching methodologies is just another, more
          polished form of lecturing, which offer considerable diminishing
          returns when compared to private lessons anyways.

          <ul>
            <li>
              I hope the psychological insufficiency of lectures not being able
              to address the subjective perceptions of each student also puts a
              last nail on the methodologies coffin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Yes, there are better techniques for teaching &mdash; which vary
              according to different subjects, by the way &mdash;, and the last
              2 centuries' methodologies have improved them a lot. However, the
              diminishing returns on them don't justify at all their current
              importance and emphasis. There's a reason why private teaching is
              still used, the most primal and the most effective way of
              teaching.

          Theory isn't enough, practice and, more importantly, constant feedback
          is what builds true expertise.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Hasn't the pandemic proven that overemphasis on theory isn't
              enough to be able to solve a problem? Researchers argued for
              decades that gain of function research would help us prepare for
              pandemics, but it turns out that, we were not only ill-prepared,
              but the risks outweighed the negatives. That's what happens when
              theory, justification and argumentation overtake reality and
              experimentation<foot-note
                text="It's a lengthy topic, but it's clear that researchers'

              Despite years of instructions, how many college graduates get a
              diploma with only a tiny amount of true expertise in the end?
              There are many factors here, but I doubt the absence of a tight
              feedback loop isn't one of them.

          Scripted classes are time-wise practical for the teacher but time-wise
          impractical for the student.

          <ul>
            <li>
              From the teacher's point of view, it's very practical to create
              panacea-like lectures and perform them year after year, it saves
              time on preparation and the mass impact on so many students surely
              seems nice. Nevertheless, it won't be sufficient because each
              student has her own interpretation; in the end they will have to
              compensate, on their own time, for the teacher's misconceptions.

              Recitation and rote memorization isn't learning, and I know most
              lectures get this point actually, but the whole setup and
              structure of the lecture implies some sort of exhaustiveness of
              knowledge, and that memorizing what the teacher said is enough.
              True knowing is flowy: any question, any articulation of the
              content can be ultimately intepreted and explained by a true
              master.

            <li>
              Shame is the elephant in the room of learning. Most teachers and
              students are busy trying to tackle content or motivational
              problems when, in fact, all impediments stem from the shame of
              making mistakes or feeling dumb<foot-note

            <li>
              And software will even lower the burden on the teacher: no more
              need for always answering the same questions, they will forever be
              registered on the platform. That also makes knowledge much more
              searchable and easier to find.
