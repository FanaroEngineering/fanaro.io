      <h1>How I created my logo</h1>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="The Idea"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          The idea behind my logo came to me after struggling with the
          infinitely fragmented knowledge typically featured in schools and
          universities. Centralization and connections within each person's
          knowledge base has since become one of my most important missions, my
          main compass<foot-note
            text="For example, I'm constantly taking notes in textual format
            (Markdown), and cataloguing, and tagging them. At first I was either
            using Evernote or Notion to do this, but I gradually transitioned
            into using Linux tools and Git to manage my notes database."
          ></foot-note
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not surprisingly, some people also do get it, and have come to the
          same conclusion, albeit through very different paths. For example, Dr.
          Alan Watkins<foot-note
            text="If you haven't, go watch his
            &lt;a href='https://youtu.be/q06YIWCR2Js'&gt;amazing lecture&lt;/a&gt;
            on how to better perform under pressure."
          ></foot-note
          >, in his book
          <a
            href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18210521-coherence?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=yVDHHh3LV8&rank=2"
            ><em>Coherence</em></a
          >, argues that the challenge for the 21st century will lie on
          reintegrating all of our overspecialized, island fields: otherwise we
          will, as some science fiction has already stated, end up
          <em>knowing everything about nothing</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The marketplace seems to be the culprit, at least in many regards. The
          more specialized you are, the more sought after you will be; generic
          problems can be solved by most, after all. However, this can backfire
          when the complexity of the managed system starts to spread along
          different subjects. That might be one of the major causes of why
          there's usually a critical mass or size for many companies before they
          crumble under their own complexity weight, giving rise to usually
          newer, leaner, less complicated competitors. The cycle of corporate
          life repeats, and humans, who have a hard time learning from their
          ancestors' mistakes, will have an even harder time learning from their
          less relatable corporate ancestors' mistakes.
        </p>

        <p>
          This capitalist problem creeps into universities and schools as well,
          but maybe in a different shape. The more isolated departments are from
          each other, the easier it is to justify their own existence and
          budgets, the easier it is to make it hard for others to get anything
          done within your topic.

        <custom-h2 text="The Math Supporting The Design"></custom-h2>

        <custom-h3 text="The Formula"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          It's easy to spot why people find it hard and cumbersome to keep
          everything connected. By laying it out in a graph<foot-note
            text="Just a fancy word for a drawing with nodes and connections."
          ></foot-note
          >, we can see that different topics, with usually sequential
          connections, form a polygon. Connections between all the vertices of
          the polygon seem to grow very quickly as we grow the number of sides.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="connected_pentagon_subjects.png"
            height="350px"
            alt="Connected Pentagon of Different Subjects"
          />
          <figcaption>
            An example of different subjects connected in a polygonal network. I
            do get that sometimes, if not often, connecting subjects can be
            difficult: how is math connected to English? But the toughest
            connections can yield the highest rewards, like machine learning
            with natural languages &mdash; see
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory"
              >LSTM</a
            >s and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/">GPT-3</a>, for
            instance.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <br />

        <p>
          That's because they grow quadratically &mdash; \(O(n^2)\) &mdash;, not
          linearly &mdash; \(O(n)\). In other words, the number of connections,
          specially the inner ones, as we shall see, grows with the square of
          the number of sides, which is jargon for "boy, do they grow fast". But
          how exactly do they grow, you might ask?
        </p>

        <p>
          It turns out that connecting dots is analogous to making
          <em>combinations</em> of pairs. That means order doesn't matter, so we
          can use the somewhat basic
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination"
            >combinatorics formula</a
          ><foot-note
            text="This is coincidentally
            &lt;a href='https://fanaro.io/articles/scrum_2/scrum_2.html#3-communication-channels-inside-teams-(p-59)'&gt;the same formula used to justify the optimal
            size of programming teams in Scrum&lt;/a&gt;."
          ></foot-note>
          we learn in high school &mdash; \(n\) stands for number of vertices or
          sides of the polygon &mdash;:
        </p>

        \begin{align} &\# \ of \ Connections(n) = C_{n, 2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n -
        2)!} = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}, \ for \ n \geq 3 \\ &\# \ of \ Internal \
        Connections(n) = C_{n,2} - n = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} - n = \frac{n(n -
        3)}{2}, \ for \ n \geq 3 \end{align}

        <p>
          Notice from above that the number of internal connections also still
          grows quadratically, even though the perimeter grows linearly. This is
          yet another justification for taking a strong stance towards
          connecting knowledge:
          <strong
            >connecting knowledge grows more quickly than gathering/creating
            knowledge sequentially</strong
          >, although creating the nodes is still necessary, of course.
        </p>

        <custom-h3 text="Why a Hexagon"></custom-h3>

        <p>
          <em>But why exactly did I choose a hexagon shape for my logo?</em> Is
          it just because it looks symmetrical and kind of nice?
        </p>

        <p>
          Nope. I chose it because it stands in the transition between
          <em>where perimeter connections are more numerous</em> and
          <em>where inner connections start ruling the land</em>. It's the first
          polygon where the number of internal connections are higher than their
          outer counterparts, as you can see from the table below:
        </p>

        <custom-h2 text="Polishing the Design to Its Final Form"></custom-h2>

        <p>The overall shape of the design is, then, settled, so what now?</p>

        <p>
          Here are some extra decisions I had to take in order to get to the end
          result:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I decided to take out the center part of the connected hexagon
            because the outer edges already represent the connections
            sufficiently, and it also seemed to be bloating up the logo, there
            was too much information within it. The inner part is also not a
            hexagon, but a square, for mostly the same reason: a square seems
            less complex than a hexagon.
          </li>
          <li>
            When coloring, I confess I ran out of ideas. But then I thought:
            running out of ideas should be in the design: how about random,
            pretty colors? So I searched for a nice gradient &mdash; I find that
            <em>good</em> gradients can lend a design smoothness and a sense of
            calmness &mdash;, this set of colors is used a lot in modern app
            design. If you're inclined to interpretations still, I would say
            this light-blue-to-reddish gradient could represent some sort of
            warm-up, in the sense that more connections are activating the
            global network more.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will often see non-pointy designs nowadays, or shapes with
            smoothed corners. That comes from a psychological inclination humans
            have towards pointy objects<foot-note
              text="This I've learned from the &lt;a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/130730.Universal_Principles_of_Design?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=nqTOYJHuH8&rank=1'&gt;&lt;em&gt;Universal Principles of
              Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; book, by Lidwell et al. I've already written an
              &lt;a href='https://fanaro.io/articles/universal_principles_design/universal_principles_design.html'&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;
              about that book."
            ></foot-note>
            &mdash; like knives &mdash;, which call our attention because they
            usually represent danger. So, naturally, I, at first, wanted to
            smooth the corners a little bit. However I ultimately reversed my
            decision so the logo would stand out even more. But that's something
            I might change in the future, I don't know.

        <custom-h2 text="Final Thoughts"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          So what do you think about my logo and its reasoning? Great? An
          amazing example of overengineering? Maybe you think the equivalence
          between knowledge and graphs is a false or insufficient one?
        </p>

        <p>
          Personally, working on the connections throughout the past few years
          has been both a source of relief and pleasure. Not only do I have
          access to basically every piece of knowledge I possess, no matter in
          which subject I am, but the connections themselves seem to generate
          knowledge, not only the nodes.

            do not agree with that assertion. Some of Chris' tips helped me a
            lot in many aspects of life, so I deem his work as a very valuable
