      <h1>Search Engine Index</h1>

      <section>
        <custom-h2 text="Motivation"></custom-h2>

        <p>
          Everyone knows Google's value nowadays. Even though they were not the
          first search engine, they certainly made it <em>the tool</em> of the
          last decades. Sites like Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc look like search
          engines and act as such, but there are other sites in which we
          constantly search and use as search engines &mdash; YouTube and
          Wikipedia are 2 simple examples &mdash; despite them not being fully
          categorized in the search area. This article is mostly dedicated to
          being a compendium of these tools so that you may come back whenever
          you wish to experiment with something new or improve your setup.
        </p>

        <p>
          And who knows... maybe someone will create new search engines after
          having the zoomed out view I'm providing here.

          Did I miss an important search engine in the table below? If so,
          please do email me at:

        <blockquote>
          Let me know if it would be worthwhile to create a true, programmatic
          database for the table below &mdash; it just kept on growing and
          growing...
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The tables below feature all of the relevant search engines I could
          find or remember, even those that are kind of known to anyone living
          on this planet: it's important to list them all, in my opinion.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've also tried to categorize the SEs into the subsections below, but
          many of them could be used for many other tasks, of course.

          My complete qutebrowser configurations are
          <a
            href="https://github.com/psygo/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/qutebrowser/config.py"

          to it.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          In qutebrowser, you have 2 options to manage your configurations:
          <code>autoconfig.yml</code> and <code>config.py</code>. The YAML file
          is much easier to read, but much more limited, and you won't have
          access to any logical operations, since you're not really using a
          programming language to configure your browser.
          <code>autoconfig.yml</code> will get you going at first, but I
          recommend you translate your configurations as soon as possible into
          its Python counterpart; isolate and centralize things thence, it's
          gonna be a much simpler and cleaner setup &mdash; add this line to the
          top of your <code>config.py</code> as well:
          <code>config.load_autoconfig(False)</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you're done with the translation, you will able to mess around
          with your search engine shortcuts. For example, when opening a new
          page, you can use
          <code>:open &lt;search-engine-shortcut&gt; &lt;search-query&gt;</code
          >. I typically prefix my search engine shortcuts with
          <code>:</code> so they don't collide with common words or other
          commands, but you can use whatever you want. Don't forget to add
          <code>{}</code> as a placeholder for your search queries. Most
          websites use <code>/search?q=</code> as a URL code for search queries,
          but you will have to test in each one before being sure, this is not
          standardized anywhere after all, it's the website's choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Brave, as most other Chromium-based browsers, also features this same
          search engine shortcuts possibility. To tweak it, go to
          <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Manage search engines</code>.
          Surprisingly, I think the GUI layout they chose for this part of the
          settings obfuscates the feature they are trying to convey, it took me
          a long while to realize what that part of the settings was about.
          Hopefully, what I explained above for qutebrowser will help you
          navigate it better.
